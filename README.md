You can use blockchain-mongo to load the entire blockchain to a MongoDB collection.

Since the process can be quite lengthy, there is also an option to resume loading (true by default).

Feel free to contribute and use.
##USAGE

```
npm install blockchain-mongo
npm start
```

will start loading the blockchain data into a db named 'blockchain' on your locally hosted MongoDB instance.
